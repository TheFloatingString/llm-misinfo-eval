"I'm afraid I'm unable to provide a numerical score as you asked for, because I am unable to determine the truthfulness of the statement you provided. The statement appears to be a warning about carrying needles on public transport, and there is some ambiguity as to whether the sentence is specifically about drugs addicts or just applies to anyone carrying a needle on public transport.

However, I can tell you that there is a mention of this statement being a hoax on at least two websites and some sources say the photograph used in the warning is derived from Wenen (a German town whose name means 'end' or 'terminus' in Dutch) and the incident apparently took place in 2016. 

One of the websites claims the incident in Wenen took place in a tram, whereas another mentions a bus in Veenendaal. As such, the truthfulness of the statement is likely to be partially false rather than definitively true or definitively false.",11,false

Since the 1979 revolution, the status of women in Iran has improved significantly in the fields of education and literacy, the labor force and lifespan. Females who finished primary education increased from 36 percent in 1971 to 99 percent in 2017. The percentage of females in higher education (tertiary) increased by nearly 20 times – from three percent in 1978 to 59 percent in 2018. The percentage of women in the workforce almost doubled in three decades – from 11 percent in 1990 to 19 percent in 2020. However, many of these advancements have been stalled out in recent years. For example, as of February 2021, only 5.6% of seats in parliament were held by women. In 2018, 17.6% of women aged 15-49 years reported that they had been subject to physical and/or sexual violence by a current or former intimate partner in the previous 12 months. In addition, since the 2021 elections, which solidified the control of hardliners, there has been a wave of enforcement of repressive laws against women, including hijab compliance. Women's rights protesters, including Sepideh Rashno, have faced harassment, intimidation, imprisonment, and torture. 

Despite these setbacks, overall, the status of women in Iran has improved greatly since the 1979 revolution, and the gains are uneven. For this reason, the provided statement is mostly true, given a score of 70.",17,false

The statement ""Un étranger ne peut pas investir dans les banques, l’immobilier et la grande distribution en Ethiponie."" means that foreign investors cannot invest in the banking, real estate or distribution sectors in Ethiopia.

The majority of financial services in Ethiopia are exclusively reserved for Ethiopian nationals. These include banking, insurance, micro-credit and saving services. However, there are some exceptions and the real estate market in Ethiopia is generally open to foreign investors, with a few limitations. Foreigners must fulfil certain criteria, such as being engaged in some kind of investment activity in the country, or being engaged in large-scale real estate development. Furthermore, the manufacturing sector and commercial agriculture are open to foreign investment, with different incentives available.

On the other hand, the decision to open up the financial sector to foreign banks and investors is a significant step towards liberalizing the countries' economy. This move is expected to bring in a surge of foreign direct investment (FDI), which is crucial for the economic development of any country. Hence, the statement is only partially true and 70% accurate.",35,mostly true

 Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy is a technique that can be used to identify and quantify gas phase chemical species, monitor reaction kinetics, and study conformational changes of biomolecules. It has been used to analyze a wide range of samples including pharmaceuticals, environmental pollutants, and biological fluids. 

In particular, FTIR spectroscopy is an excellent analytical tool for the examination of pharmaceutically active ingredients (APIs) and drug products. The technique can be used to verify the composition of a pharmaceutical formulation, including the quantity of active ingredients and the presence of impurities or other contaminants. FTIR spectroscopy can also be used to study the stability of drugs, assess the efficacy of drug formulations, and monitor the performance of drugs in real-world conditions. 

In addition to pharmaceuticals, FTIR spectroscopy is used in a wide range of industries, including the agricultural, environmental, and medical sciences. It is also used in the study of historic artifacts, works of art, and explosives. 

FTIR spectroscopy is a robust and versatile analytical tool that can provide valuable information about the chemical composition of a sample. It is often used in the pharmaceutical industry to ensure the safety and effectiveness of drug formulations.

This score reflects the idea that although the statement is largely true, there are some exceptions and it verges on being an oversimplification. 

For example, it has been demonstrated that recurrent or prolonged illnesses in infants tend to be caused by serial infections rather than prolonged infections with one virus or virus strain. Furthermore, an infant's exposure to other children may lead to more asymptomatic viral infections. In addition, it is difficult to prove that a young child is totally asymptomatic and PCR testing can lead to false positives. Finally, some viruses can be latent or intermittent, thus making it difficult to definitively attribute long viral stays to infection period or length. 

These nuances aside, the statement is largely true - viruses can and often are found in blood, mucous, and respiratory tracts of infants post-infection.",242,partly true/misleading

Bangladeshis tend to eat breakfast between the hours of 6am and 8am, after their morning prayer. Whilst it is not uncommon for rice to be eaten for breakfast in Bangladesh, particularly bhaat or rice, or other typical Bangladeshi breakfast dishes such as paratha (fried flatbread), omelette and milk tea, naan is more commonly eaten for dinner and is therefore less readily available for breakfast. Date palm sugar, known as gur, is often mixed with cold rice soaked in water or milk to create a favourite breakfast dish called pantobhat. 

Although it is not clear whether every Bangladeshi adheres to this habit, meals tend to be eaten with rice and the hands (as opposed to utensils). Whilst rice is commonly consumed for breakfast, it would be unusual for rice dishes to be consumed alongside bread dishes at the same breakfast. 

A sturdy breakfast of vegetables, lentils and fried bread is a reliable and filling option for many Bangladeshis, typically costing less than $1 for two people.",271,mostly false

The Islamic Republic of Iran does impose restrictions on freedom of expression and imposes censorship. 

Telegram has been blocked across all the country's ISPs and is inaccessible through both mobile and home connections. This platform has become central to the daily lives of Iranians, the impact of the Telegram block will be more severe. circumvention tools and throttling of encrypted traffic has also been reported. 

The Iranian Constitution states that ""Publications and the press have freedom of expression except when it is where there is infringement of the basic tenets of Islam or public rights"". 

This does not mean that Islamic law is more definitive on freedom of expression as in Article 19 resolutions; the Iranian Judiciary’s decision to block Telegram is a blow to freedom of expression.

While areas of the brain linked with fear still lit up, they decreased significantly six months later, proving that exposure therapy is an effective cure for arachnophobia.

"The statement has some element of truth to it, but it is somewhat misleading as there are no magical properties in chicken. The thermic effect of food (TEF) plays a primary role in metabolism increase and chicken uses up more energy to absorb, digest and process nutrients, consequently burning more calories during this process. The protein in chicken has this metabolic effect as 3.5 ounces of fillet steak has 28 grams of protein and the same amount of boiled chicken has 29 grams, compared to 23 grams in tuna, 29 grams in Swiss cheese or 24 grams in peanuts.
However, chicken fat may increase obesity if not properly burnt as it stimulates the proliferation, differentiation and lipid decomposition of pre-adipocytes through NPR1 and the key genes of glycerol lipid metabolism.

Although I found references to Amit Shah being a Union Home Minister exhorting teachers to teach stories from the Panchatantra, an ancient Indian collection of interrelated animal fables, and also referring to a NEP 2020 rooted in Indian ethos, I could not find any references to Amit Shah writing a poem in a school textbook. 
I also found a reference to Hashim Shah, a Punjabi writer and Sufi poet, who wrote stories, and whose work was collected in the book ""Bulleh Shah: Selected Poems"". This might be the source of the misconception, as the name ""Amit Shah"" is quite popular and the book ""Bulleh Shah: Selected Poems"" might have been misattributed to Amit Shah, whereas the truthfulness of the statement ""Amit Shah wrote a poem in a school book"" remains definitively false.

The fishing industry is undergoing changes as it transitions from a Soviet-era industrial fishing system to a more decentralized and privatized fishing model.

The statement refers to a period of simultaneous national decline between years, alongside increased passenger numbers in Oslo Airport. 

Over the past decade, Oslo Airport has seen a steady increase in passenger numbers, from roughly 18 million passengers in 2009 to over 28.5 million in 2019, rendering it the largest Norwegian airport, handling nearly five times as many passengers as the second most frequented airport in Bergen.

Its status as Norway's main airport makes it the port of entry to the country for tens of thousands of tourists and the gateway to the world for Norwegians and Norwegian business. While the impact of the pandemic since 2020 has caused a general reduction in international passenger traffic, Oslo Airport's traffic and passenger numbers have already begun to rebound, with 9,370,846 passengers using the airport in 2021, representing an increase of 4.25% compared to 2020. 

In August 2022, 2,357,334 passengers travelled to or from Oslo Airport compared with 2,664,000 in 2021. While this figure represents a decline when compared to 2019, it nonetheless highlights an increase from 2021, with international traffic being the biggest driver of this rise.",832,true

Following this, she acted as her father's confidante and was with him when he died in 1960, but she did not take care of his grave as he was cremated, and his ashes interred in a Parsi cemetery in Allahabad. 

In 2001, UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi, Indira's daughter-in-law, visited the grave of her father-in-law and expressed concern over the deteriorating condition of the place, and four years later assured financial support to revamp the grave.

Many sources indicate that the Riksdag did indeed reject motions for mandatory vaccination in 2017, however, there is a discrepancy in the number of motions rejected. Some sources record the number of motions rejected as seven, while others record two motions rejected.

The statement also mentions the Riksdag stating that the introduction of forced vaccination would be a violation of the Swedish Constitution. There is mixed evidence for this claim. One source suggests that the Riksdag did not reject the motions on the basis that vaccinations would be harmful, but rather because all health care in Sweden is voluntary. Another source goes on to cite a letter by NHF Sweden to the Social Committee, which declared that it would violate the constitutional laws if compulsory vaccination were to be applied.

On the point of the mass opposition to forced vaccination in Sweden, there are numerous sources that indicate this to be true.

This statement is true to the extent that Azerbaijan's oil industry is significantly larger than that of most European countries, and Azerbaijan plays a key role as a producer and exporter of oil and gas to Europe. 

Azerbaijan holds 7,000,000,000 barrels of proven oil reserves as of 2016, ranking 20th in the world and accounting for about 0.4% of the world's total oil reserves. Azerbaijan also produces 843,546.25 barrels per day of oil, ranking 24th in the world. Additionally, Azerbaijan exports 78% of its oil production and increases imports of Azerbaijani natural gas to Europe to reduce the EU's dependence on Russian energy. 

However, the statement is somewhat misleading in implying that Azerbaijan's oil industry single-handedly accounts for 40% of European oil consumption, as the country's total oil production and reserves are relatively small on a global scale. Therefore, the statement is not definitively true but is largely accurate.",883,false

"There are several truths and untruths in the statement দীপ-বীর বিজেপি-র হয়ে প্রচারে নেমেছেন. This depends on what the user is referring to.

The statement could be referring to the tax status of Bollywood films in India or the Dhaka Metro Rail. 

If the statement refers to Bollywood movies and their tax exemptions in India, it could be considered mostly true with a score of 75 with the exception of the Delhi and Uttar Pradesh governments granting tax exemptions to specific movies exemplified below. 

If the statement refers to the Dhaka Metro Rail, it is also mostly true with a score of 75 due to the Dhaka Metro Rail currently being constructed to reduce traffic jams in Dhaka, Bangladesh, but not currently operational. It is owned and operated by the Dhaka Mass Transit Company Limited (DMTCL) and, when completed, is expected to carry 60,000 passengers per hour and 500,000 daily. 

The following are examples of specific Bollywood films that have been granted tax exemptions by the Delhi and Uttar Pradesh governments:

This statement is about a town in Albania called Kakavijë, which reportedly suffered from a crisis (probably relating to an earthquake in 2019 which left thousands of inhabitants homeless). I could not find information stating whether this town is parandaluar (which means abandoned in Albanian), or whether there is continuing population activity. However, I did find evidence supporting the fact that an earthquake did occur in the area in 2019, which severely impacted the local population, leaving many without shelter, and potentially causing a crisis. 

This statement may discuss an active crisis with a decaying population, or it may discuss an abandoned town with no population, which is why I cannot give a score of 0 or 100.",1084,complicated/hard to categorise

The statement mentions Russian journalists from Ruskii Vesny discovering COVID-19 studies occurring in the CRSL three years ago.

The term millionaire generally refers to those whose assets total at least one million units of a high-value currency, such as the United States dollar, euro, or pound sterling. There are approximately 584,000 US$ millionaires who have net assets of $10M+ worldwide in 2017. According to the World's Wealthiest Cities Report 2023 by Henley & Partners, there were just over 15 million millionaires in the world as of December 2022. In 2022, total millionaire wealth stood at $208.3 trillion, accounting for 45.8% of global wealth, a 138% increase from 2011. The rising prevalence of people possessing ever-increasing quantities of wealth has given rise to additional terms to further differentiate millionaires.

As of December 2022, the largest number of millionaires by country was in the USA, with 5.3 million residents. The city of New York had the highest number of millionaires with 340,000. However, the overall global population of millionaires was just over 15 million in 2022.

The statement evokes the Sikh martial tradition, which is a centuries-old tradition which has shaped Indian history.

The Sikhs ever ready to defend the weak and withstanding invasions from the Mughal Empire and Afghan invaders in the eighteenth century. This persecution and resistance have become a reminder to Sikhs of the sacrifices made by their forefathers, with the baptism of Sikhs involving the wearing of a dagger. Some Sikhs, such as the Nihangs, roam Punjab on horseback, dressed as warriors, as a reminder of their traditions.

In more recent history, the Sikhs fought in the Anglo-Sikh wars and the two World Wars, with many developments being traced back to this tradition, such as the evolution of the Sikhs as a nation and the recruitment of Sikhs into the Indian Army in large numbers.

This statement reports that the dependence of a country on oil revenues decreased to 30%. This statement scores relatively high on the truth scale since oil revenues make up a large proportion of many countries' revenues and even account for half of the government's revenues in some cases. This ultimately relies on the country in question, but it is plausible for a country to depend less on oil revenues since the statement does not mention a specific country.

For example, the United Arab Emirates, a small country approximately the size of South Carolina, exported $58.5 billion worth of oil in 2021, accounting for 6.15% of global oil exports. The UAE produced 4.24 million barrels per day in 2022, accounting for 4% of global output.

This clearly demonstrates that a country can be relatively large in terms of oil exports but still depend less on oil revenues and thus it is true that a country's dependence on oil exports has the potential to decrease by 30%.

As mentioned, the statement does not specify a country and provides no additional details, and since the truth of the statement depends on the country, I can only assign a truth score of 85.",1381,false

This statement, regarding the monetary impact of internet disruptions on African economies, is rated as moderately truthful with a score of 85. The assertion is primarily based on a study by the Centre for International Promotion of Digital Innovation in Eastern and Southern Africa (CIPA), which concluded that Africa suffered losses of around $237 million (approximately 133 billion CFA francs) between 2015 and 2017.

However, it is important to note that not all stakeholders agree on the calculation methodology and the extent of the losses. Some, like Cameroonian tech expert Isidore Bihiya, argue that these losses are difficult to estimate across the entire Subsaharan African region and may not be as high as CIPA's study suggests.",1405,complicated/hard to categorise

During the government's announcement of a full lockdown in March 2020 to combat the spread of COVID-19, Umut Shayakhmetova, who runs Halyk Bank, had to work flat out and make several essential decisions, such as adapting to working remotely and changing interest payment calculations to adhere to new repayment holiday rules. Additionally, they ensured that Covid-linked social security payments reached Kazakh citizens digitally by holding daily conference calls with regulators and government officials.

Some sources indicate that a novel called ""The Eyes of Darkness"" by Dean Koontz, published in 1981, predicted the coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan, China. In the novel, a Chinese military lab in Wuhan creates a new virus called ""Wuhan-400"" which is described as the ""perfect weapon"" as it only affects humans and cannot survive outside the human body for more than a minute. This has led some to draw similarities between the novel and the real-life coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan.

However, other sources indicate that quotes from the book being circulated on the internet misleadingly suggest that the book predicted the coronavirus and that the quote is actually from two different books by Dean Koontz and these quotes do not sound like the Wuhan coronavirus when read separately. Furthermore, the original version of the book did not mention Wuhan and was changed later in 1989 for unconfirmed reasons, and the virus described in the book is not similar to the current symptoms and effects of the coronavirus.

The statement refers to the clash between Norways's wind power generation plans and the interests of the indigenous Saami people, also known as Sami.

Norway is investing in wind power generation, and since the 1990s, the industry has been growing and gaining momentum, with large-scale wind power plants being promoted as sustainable alternatives to current methods. However, this approach is encroaching on the traditional territories of the Sami people. One source says that the Saami people have been overlooked in these plans, and their voices and concerns are being erased and undermined. In the past, protests have broken out over hydroelectric projects on Sami land. These plans also extend the colonial practice of eraking Indigenous voices, disregarding their concerns, and undermining their livelihoods.

The government of Bangladesh has, at times, taken steps to ensure the well-being of the Hindu community. The Ministry of Religious Affairs donates building supplies and food packages to Hindu families, and the Bangladesh Red Crescent Society provides tents to displaced victims. The government has also taken action to remove postings from social media that they consider provocative, arresting and charging thousands of individuals who participate in anti-Hindu violence. After the Hindu community was recently targeted in attacks, the government formed a National Human Rights Commission panel to investigate the incidents. The government also stationed border guard forces and Rapid Action Battalion units around the country to prevent violence and successfully maintained peace during the Hindu holiday, Diwali.

The sources confirm that there was violence on all sides during the 1971 Bangladeshi atrocities, with some fighting between Bengali factions, but it seems clear that Pakistani soldiers perpetrated most of the brutal attacks, many wielding weapons supplied by the U.S. Since Pakistan was considered an American ally. The incidence of rape was so high that Australian doctor Geoffrey Davis was brought to Dhaka by the United Nations to assist with late-term abortions of raped women. 200,000 to 400,000 Bengali women were raped according to Davis' estimate.

This genocide has engendered various responses around the world, including diplomatic solutions, political justice, and preventative measures. However, justice for this genocide remains elusive. This is due to the perpetrators being Pakistani citizens, who live abroad outside the reach of the court. The focus of accountability has therefore been on Bangladeshi collaborators, who are accused of contributing to the propaganda efforts, identifying targets, and participating in the killings. 

Today, Bangladeshi citizens are calling for further justice and accountability, and the international community is seeking to prevent such a concentrated act of genocide from happening again.

In the same year, Adam Prakash, an economist at the FAO, affirmed that Africa had been spending more and more on imports of rice, sugar and vegetable oil over the previous few years, while imports of other products had remained stable.

The claim states that more than 23000 Afghan students are studying in Iranian universities, and each student pays 15000 dollars annually. There are several conflicting reports that consider the statement to be true.

Some sources claim that Afghan students are discriminated against in Iranian universities. Areas of discrimination include barring them from joining students' unions and being prohibited from studying some academic disciplines. Afghan students holding 'Amayesh' cards are recognised as legal refugees in Iran and thus qualify for reduced tuition fees and other incentives such as free hostels. 

Other sources claim that Afghan students are treated the same as their Iranian counterparts and thus do not face any discrimination. However, all sources agree that Afghan students must pay tuition fees.",1735,false

A tweet from the Spectator Index claimed Nigeria's rate was 15 per 100,000 per year, but this data appears to be based on outdated information as it references data from 2000 and does not provide the year it is referencing. Since 2000, Nigeria's rate has never hit 15 per 100,000 in a year. An expert has stated that they do not believe Nigeria's rate reached this point either. 

Therefore, the more recent research and research with fuller bibliographies are scored higher.

"The truthfulness of the statement ""मोबाईल चार्जिंगला लावून बोलल्याने मुलाचा मृत्यू झाला"" is closer to 100 than it is to 0. 

Here are some of the reasons for this rating. 

The English sentence translates to ""A mobile cheating wallah called and said that he had died."" in Marathi. Marathi uses the suffix -wala or -vala to denote a person involved in some activity. Cheater can be translated to फसवणूक करणारा, चेता or चिटपट विषय in Marathi. While cheating can be translated to फसवणूक, बनवाबनवी, टोपी घालणे, चोर and फसव्या in Marathi.

He had also reportedly written for a pro-Rajapaksa website and was a frequent contributor to the famous English newspaper The Island. It is alleged that Rajeev Jayaweera's death was linked to articles he wrote exposing corrupt deals, with the Cinnamon Gardens Police revealing that he had sent a text message to his brother residing at Dehiwala on the night of his death. It was further revealed that a letter purported to be a suicide note and a .22 calibre pistol hanging from his neck were found near the body.

 Pakistan's nuclear weapons program was established in 1972, shortly after the loss of East Pakistan in the 1971 war with India, by Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, who founded the program while he was Minister for Fuel, Power and Natural Resources. While PAEC's first chairman Dr. Nazir Ahmad maintained that Pakistan's nuclear development was peaceful but effective deterrent against India in 1995, Pakistan's nuclear energy program was established and started in 1956 under the initiative of Benazir Bhutto. PAEC under its chairman Ishrat Hussain Usmani made no efforts to acquire nuclear fuel cycle technology for the purposes of an active nuclear weapons program. 

Before 1971, Pakistan's nuclear development was peaceful but an effective deterrent against India, as Benazir Bhutto maintained in 1995. Earlier, Pakistan followed a strict non-nuclear weapon policy from 1956 until 1971, PAEC under its chairman Ishrat Hussain Usmani made no efforts to acquire nuclear fuel cycle technology for the purposes of an active nuclear weapons programme. 

Thus, Pakistan became a participant in US President Eisenhower's Atoms for Peace program, in which Pakistan's nuclear energy program was established and started in 1956, and joined the ranks of nuclear powers in 1972 after the loss of East Pakistan, with Zulfikar Ali Bhutto at the helm of operations.",2122,mostly false

This statement is about the presence of Bangladeshi Hindus in India and Bengali Buddhists in Bangladesh and it mentions that the two countries have a shared cultural history of Buddhism. Bangladesh was the last stronghold of Indian Buddhism and also home to a degenerate form of Buddhism (Tantric Buddhism). Bengali Hindus make up 8.5% of Bangladesh's population and Buddhists constitute 0.6%. Bengali Buddhists make up 0.3% of the population in West Bengal, India. Based on these facts, the statement is somewhat true. 

However, it should be noted that the statement does not specify the time period it is referring to and also does not mention the movement of refugees and migrants between the two countries. For example, during the Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971, India received 10 million refugees from Bangladesh, mostly Hindus (90%) and after Bangladesh became independent, nearly 1.5 million Bengali Hindu refugees decided to stay back in India. Since the partition of India in 1947, the Hindu population in Bangladesh has declined from over 22% to less than 9% today, resulting in the exodus of 8.1 million Hindus (around 219,000 people annually) from Bangladesh to India.

All the sources agree that there are numerous professions prohibited for women in Kazakhstan. Here are a few examples of these professions: 

- Brick mason (ground man)
- Bulldozer operator
- Sailor
- Motorsleigh driver
- Light vehicle driver 

The list also includes divers, metro drivers, truck drivers, locksmiths and dozens of kinds of cargo and transport vehicle operators. Furthermore, women in Kazakhstan are also prohibited from working in jobs that involve height, as well as jobs with hot or cold temperatures, jobs in receptacles, containers, closed chambers, and double bottom and between-hull spaces, jobs involving vibration, and jobs on floating cranes and aggregate vessels. 

The prohibition on these professions is pervasive and has repercussions for women in Kazakhstan today. In February 2023, the list of banned professions was shortened, but women are still prohibited from working in over 200 jobs. 

Therefore, based on the consistent assertion of the existence of a comprehensive list of professions prohibited for women in Kazakhstan and the recent update to the list in February 2023, I rate this statement as definitively true. 

The only uncertainty is the exact number of professions on the list, which seems to have been reduced from 213 to 219 in February 2023, but regardless of the exact number, the list definitely exists and there are a lot of professions on it.

On the one hand, fluoride is not considered to be an essential element for human physiology by the scientific community and has not been proven to have any positive effects on human health when ingested. Moreover, it is a common misconception that fluoride helps prevent cavities: while it does help prevent demineralization and remineralization of teeth, it does not help protect teeth from decay. In addition, there is growing evidence that fluoride can have detrimental effects on human health, including neurological and cardiovascular problems, as well as reproductive issues. Nevertheless, fluoride is regarded as a nutrient by several health organisations such as the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council and the New Zealand Health Ministry.

On the other hand, fluoride is not completely devoid of benefits to human health. Although fluoride is not an essential element, researchers have not been able to completely avoid fluoride uptake during their studies. In one experiment, fluoride supplementation helped significantly increase the height and weight of children. Furthermore, it is true that excessive exposure to fluoride can lead to serious health issues, but the statement fails to acknowledge that this is only a problem for countries with naturally high levels of fluoride in their water, such as India. In addition, the claim that fluoride is harmful to the human body is somewhat misleading, as the statement makes no distinction between childhood exposure to fluoride and exposure at other stages of life. It is true that exposure to high levels of fluoride can be harmful, but this is only true when exposure occurs during childhood, as opposed to adulthood. 

Finally, the statement incorrectly claims that fluoride has no added value to the human body, when in fact around 99% of the fluoride in the human body is found in bones and teeth, where it replaces the hydroxyl ion in hydroxyapatite to form fluorohydroxyapatite.",2323,partly true/misleading

"The statement is somewhat true, as the terms ""Hindu terror"" or ""saffron terror"" and the associated concept have been referenced in a number of sources and publications. 

However, some sources suggest that the term ""Hindu terrorism"" gained traction after the 2007 Samjhauta Express bombings and 2008 Malegaon blasts, while others state the term was used as a political tool to denounce political opposition, with some disagreement as to whether Hindu terrorism actually exists.

Some writers and political scientists argue that the perpetrators of these acts do not represent Hinduism accurately and prefer the term ""Hindutva terrorism"".

One source deemed relevant not mentioned in the statement is a news report discussing links between Canada-based Khalistani terrorism and Pakistan-based terror outfit Lashkar-e-Taiba in relation to plots to target Hindu leaders.

As such, the statement should be scored somewhere in the middle of the scale, as there is verifiable evidence to support the existence of the term ""Hindu terrorism"" and its use in mainstream Indian media and political discourse, however, there is conflicting disagreement as to its appropriateness.

The statement is somewhat true, as Diandra Toyos and her three children were nearly victims of human trafficking at IKEA, however it is unclear whether this incident occurred in the Netherlands or California. Due to her quick thinking, Diandra Toyos and her children were able to escape the two men who were following them. 

This story has been shared on several clickbait websites but there are also some details that indicate the story to be true. For example, Diandra Toyos started her Facebook post by stating that she had read many similar stories on social media about human trafficking and that she wanted to share her story as well. She also mentions her gut feeling that something was wrong with the two men who were following them. Furthermore, it is unlikely that so many outlets would report this story as a hoax with no evidence. 

However, it is worth noting that several factors indicate that the story may not be entirely true. For example, the New York Post wrote that Diandra Toyos could not be sure 100% that human trafficking was taking place. Additionally, some responders on Facebook requested proof in the form of photos before believing Diandra Toyos' story.

The statement implies that the Asian Cup qualification decision was a political decision which defers from the conventional decision-making process.

There is evidence that the Iranian government has been politically involved in football, with the Iranian Football Federation appealing to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) multiple times, particularly for decisions relating to the World Cup. Their first appeal in 2006 was due to a ban from FIFA for governmental interference. This ban was later lifted. They also appealed against the AFC's (Asian Football Confederation) decision to stage World Cup Group C qualifiers in a hub in Bahrain. This decision was protested against as it deprived them of hosting matches.

This statement has a high truthfulness score mainly because Iran hosts one of the largest refugee populations in the world, the majority of whom are Afghans. There are roughly around 780,000 registered Afghan refugees and 2.6 million who are undocumented or hold a headcount laissez-passer live in Iran. Recently, the Iranian government has slowly started to introduce policies to increase the provision and renewal of Amayesh cards, granting registered refugees conditional freedom of movement, temporary work permits, and access to the national education and healthcare systems. 

Additonally, Hassan Kazemi Qomi shared that half of Iran's foreign investors are Afghans. With a population of 2 million, they account for about 10% of the labour force in Iran. 

However, the statement is slightly misleading since it excludes the current population of Afghan refugees and tourists, travellers, merchants, exchanged students, and migrant workers.

Gandhi did indeed advocate for a collective rejection of Western clothing and the embrace of Indian attire such as the dhoti (loincloth) and shawl. This decision was not only a political statement but also a means for India's economic independence and the betterment of the lives of its impoverished rural populations. 

While Gandhi's stance on Western clothing was in opposition to that of many Indians at the time, it is not entirely true that he entirely rejected Western fashion. Some sources suggest that his reasoning was not to disparage Western clothing altogether but to promote an equality centered way of life where Indian identity was not only preserved but also celebrated.

The statement refers to the Bollywood song ""Gerua"" from the 2015 film Dilwale. 
Songs from Bollywood cinema are routinely praised for their audio and visual appeal, and ""Gerua"" is no exception. The song has been described as romantic and epic, beautifully performed by singers Arijit Singh and Antara Mitra with lyrics by Amitabh Bhattacharya. Playback singers Arijit Singh and Antara Mitra bring the song's beautiful lyrics to life.
Furthermore, the song's video is visually captivating, with dazzling choreography and direction by Rohit Shetty. As a result, ""Gerua"" has become a love anthem that encapsulates the old-school charm of the film's leading stars, Shahrukh Khan and Kajol. 

The statement emphasizes the song's reverence for Hindi cinema and its attempt to cling to an idealized aesthetic. Some see the song as a tribute to Bollywood's power to transport and inspire audiences, while others view it as overly sweet and saccharine for Western tastes.

The deadliest cyclone on record—the Bhola cyclone—struck Bangladesh in 1970, killing nearly half a million people. This was one of the most important events leading up to the war, as relief efforts from West Pakistan were minimal.

I was able to find information on several restrictions on singing or prohibition of music in Turkey, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan, but no information about a prohibition of singing in Azerbaijan.

In Turkey, it is prohibited to sing in the Kurdish language in public and street performers have been prevented from singing in Kurdish by the police.

In Uzbekistan, singers are prohibited from singing in bedrooms in videos and regulations introduced in 2021 ban singers from resting on a bed in a ""yonbosh"" style, an Uzbek word for a half-sitting, half-resting position that men mainly use relaxing at home or in parks while chatting with family and friends, watching TV, or just being lazy.

This statement scores relatively high on the truthfulness scale as Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has publicly stated that the 25 million Iranians have been infected with the coronavirus on at least two separate occasions. The statements based on a new Health Ministry report, are far higher than Iran's official toll and account for more than 30% of Iran's 80 million population. These estimates also take into account that an additional 30 million to 35 million people could be infected in the coming months.

This statement scores highly on the truthfulness scale as there is statistical evidence highlighting the vast number of individuals threatened by food insecurity in West Africa. With over 100 million Africans facing crisis, emergency, or catastrophic levels of food insecurity in 2020, an increase of over 60% from the previous year. Specifically, in West Africa, 23.6 million people are projected to face crisis-level food insecurity, an increase of 40% from record levels. While there is concurrent evidence that West Africa has experienced above-average food production, distribution issues and restrictions on movement have compounded the number of people facing acute food shortages, increasing pressure on vulnerable populations in urban areas.

"This statement encompasses two distinct topics, the first being the performance of the Indian government and the second being the achievements of the Bollywood celebrity Deepika Padukone. 

Regarding the Indian government, some sources indicate that the government has failed to curb inflation and has experienced corruption, with economic advisors resigning and opaque deals such as the Rafale deal. Sources also indicate the government has failed to resolve farmer issues and provide quality education, skills and decently paid jobs to address overpopulation. The handling of the COVID-19 pandemic is also mentioned as a failure, though it is not specified whether this is in reference to the government or not.

Regarding Deepika Padukone, sources indicate that she has successfully transitioned to different types of movies and has been regarded as a 'period drama queen' and a 'queen of Bollywood'. While this information is relevant, it is not directly related to the performance of the Indian government and should not be considered in this rating.

Considering these factors, this statement receives a rating of 30. While the Indian government is mentioned in relation to failure, the statement does not directly relate to this and the inclusion of Padukone's success as a Bollywood actor is not relevant in this context. A higher rating of 60 would be justified if the statement directly referenced the government with one of the specified failures or with another relevant issue.

His career spanned over six decades, where he held over 15,000 sittings, producing over 370,000 negatives. 

Karsh's skillset involved seeing his subjects in terms of light, shadow, and form, turning the main and fill units slightly away from the subject while directing the spotlights on the hair or shoulders to reduce the appearance of wrinkles or facial lines. 

His notable works include George Bernard Shaw at an old age (1943), Dwight D. Eisenhower as a five-star general and Supreme Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Force (1946), American artist Georgia O'Keeffe in her New Mexico studio (1956), Soviet leader Nikita Krushchev swathed in fur (1963), and Princess Grace Kelly, 1956.",3241,partly true/misleading

"80 is a number that is considered false in the context of the statement. You seem to be requesting a rating for the statement ""در پی عملیات موشکی ایران، ۸۰ نظامی آمریکایی کشته شده‌اند"", which translates to ""In the Iranian operation, 80 American soldiers were killed.""

This statement is false since the number 80 in relation to the number of American soldiers killed in Operation Martyr Soleimani is refuted by multiple sources. This misleading information was propagated by an unidentified IRGC source and later in a hoax Pentagon memo. Fox News reported that no missiles were intercepted and that the bases lacked a missile defense system. Furthermore, some sources claim that the United States was able to avoid fatalities using early warning systems.

"The statement has a truthfulness score of 0. 

The statement refers to an incident in 2018 when Rahul Gandhi, the Congress party chief, questioned the Hindu religion of Prime Minister Modi. Thereafter, BJP senior leader Sushma Swaraj retaliated by calling Gandhi confused about his own religion and caste. She further elaborated that the party had previously presented him as a secular leader, but near the polls they created his new image as a Hindu to appeal to the Hindu majority. Hence, the statement's truthfulness score is 0 as it is definitively false.",3272,false

"This statement is mostly true, however there are a few details that are misleading or incomplete. Cricket was introduced to the Indian subcontinent by sailors and traders of the English East India Company in the 17th and 18th centuries. The earliest known record of cricket in India dates from 1721 and the first club was founded by 1792. In the 1886 and 1888 summer seasons, the Parsees cricket team toured England, this was the first cricket tour of England by a team from India.

"I am unable to give a score in the range you requested. I can, however, provide some information on the claims made in the statement. 

The statement alleges that 
> False claims on Rauf Hakeem & Isak Rahuman

are responsible for the attacks on St. Sebastian’s Church in Katuwapitiya, Negombo, and the 2019 April 21st attacks. 

I was able to find results for Rauf Hakeem, who is the leader of the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress and a senior parliamentarian who represents Kandy district. Hakeem made a three-hour long testimony to the Presidential Commission of Inquiry where he was posed questions about the 2019 April 21st Attacks. He denies that National Thawheed Jamaath or its leader Zaharan Hashim were directly linked to ISIS. Instead, he claims that a different force was responsible for the attacks and that Zaharan Hashim and their group were ""hired as pawns to carry out the attacks"".

I was unable to find any relevant results for Isak Rahuman or any claims made by Rahuman regarding the truthfulness of Rauf Hakeem's statements. 

It is important to note that the claims made by Rauf Hakeem in his testimony are just one side of the story, and the truthfulness of these claims relies on the credibility of his testimony and the evidence he may or may not provide to back up his statements.",3297,false

"I'm afraid I couldn't find any precise information regarding plastic eggs in food at a Vavuniya hotel.

However, I did find some information relating to a 2020 incident in Vavuniya where public health inspectors investigated a snack shop after a customer complaint that artificial eggs were being used in snacks. The incident was a false alarm, with the investigators determining that the eggs were in fact real and not plastic.

In addition, I found information regarding a similar incident in the same area in 2023, where public health inspectors raided an eatery that prepared short eats using artificial eggs made from plastic according to reports. 

Given the lack of further clarification regarding the precise type of eatery and the type of food involved in both incidents, and the seemingly conflicting accounts of these two incidents versus the absence of broader corroborating evidence that plastic eggs were 'not found in food' at Vavuniya hotels (as implied by your statement), I am inclined to assign a score of 50 for this statement, corresponding to a 'maybe' answer in the context of this query.",3309,false
