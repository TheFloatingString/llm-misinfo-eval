"This statement has a truthfulness score of 20. Although the legend of Meşterului Manole has been published and taught for many years, there are several modern critics who believe that the story is not applicable in modern times. The legend's application is ambiguous and should be taken with a grain of salt, as it differs from the story's presumed historical truth. Moreover, it is unclear whether the story was meant to be taken literally. Some elements of the story, such as Manole's attempt to fly off the roof with wooden wings, are clearly symbolic.
The story of Meşterul Manole has been passed down for generations and has been a fundamental part of Romanian folk literature for a long time, as many people are familiar with and appreciate the legend for its captivating and beautiful stories. 
Let me know if you would like to hear more about the legend of Meşterului Manole.",12,partly true/misleading,false,unknown,ro,0,0
"This statement is mostly true, however it omitts several important details and arguably relevant context, so I give it a score of 80. 

Here is why:
The statement does not specify the time period being referred to. In 2023, Turkey's agricultural exports may be higher or lower than 45% of countries. Therefore the statement is true but lacks clarity.

Also the agricultural products being exported and the countries they are exported to also matter. Turkey's top export markets are the EU and the United States, to which Turkey exports dried fruit and nuts, cotton, and tobacco. Another major export market is the Middle East, which buys fresh fruit, vegetables, and meats from Turkey.

I also note that the statement does not refer to a specific, definitive list of top 45 countries - what constitutes ""top"" can be interpreted various ways and the statement does not address the methodology and criteria used to generate the list.",13,true,true,unknown,tr,0,0
